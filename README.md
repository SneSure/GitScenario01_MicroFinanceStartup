# GitScenario01_MicroFinanceStartup
This project is for a micro-finance startup with a mission to empower and provide opprtunities to low income individuals. 

The core team currently uses Subversion (SVN) for managing code and want to slowly move their code to Git. 

In this project I will be using Git by following best practices to help the company
host their sample code to calculate simple interest

Thanks!
